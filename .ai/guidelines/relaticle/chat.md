# Chat tools + custom fields

Chat tools (`packages/Chat/src/Tools/*/Create*Tool.php` and `Update*Tool.php`) automatically support **every** active custom field for their entity. Adding a new field to `app/Enums/CustomFields/*Field.php` (or via the Custom Fields admin UI) is enough — do NOT add per-field schema slots, value coercion, or display rows to the chat tool. The bridge services in `packages/Chat/src/Services/Tools/` handle:

- Inlining a per-tenant `custom_fields` schema description so the LLM knows the valid codes and option labels.
- Translating option labels back to option IDs at validation time.
- Formatting the proposal-card "old → new" diff per field type.

If you need a custom field to be **un-settable** from chat, mark it `active=false` on the `custom_fields` row, or add a tool-side allowlist filter inside `CustomFieldsSchemaDescriber`. Don't reach for hand-rolled per-field code.
